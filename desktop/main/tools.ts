  "Actions:\n" +
  "set — start pursuing objective. Write it as the end state, with what \"done\" looks like inside it, because every later turn is judged against those words and nothing else. tokenBudget caps the whole pursuit and defaults to 200000; this replaces whatever the thread was pursuing before.\n" +
  "get — the objective, the status, the turns taken, the seconds spent, and the budget left.\n" +
  "update — status active, paused, complete or blocked. complete is refused without evidence, and evidence means the end state itself: what you ran, what it printed, what changed. Never send it because the budget is nearly gone or because you are stopping. blocked wants reason, one line naming what is in the way; it only sticks once the same blocker has stopped you on three consecutive goal turns, so report it and keep working — Emma counts the streak, and a goal picked back up counts again from zero.\n" +
  "extend — add extraTokens to the budget and start pursuing again, for a goal that ran out with real work left. Ask the user first: it is their spend.\n" +
  "clear — stop pursuing and take the goal off the thread. That is the user dropping it, not you deciding it is hard.\n" +
