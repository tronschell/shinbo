description: How to run the user's other coding CLIs — Claude Code, Codex, Pi, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Antigravity CLI — from inside Shinbo with the `cli` and `cli_runs` tools; which one to pick, how to brief it, how to take turns with it, and when to do the work yourself instead. Use whenever the user names one of those CLIs, asks for a second agent's take on the same code, asks what coding agents they have installed, or asks to hand a job to something other than Shinbo.

# Running the other CLIs

Shinbo is a meta harness. The user has already installed and configured coding
agents — Claude Code, Codex, Pi, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Antigravity CLI — and Shinbo runs the one they
want in the thread's own folder rather than reimplementing it.

This skill ships with the app and is rewritten from `desktop/skills/` on every
launch. Do not edit it with `write_skill`; write what you learn as a separate
skill and it survives.

## The two tools

| Ask | Call |
|---|---|
| what is installed, what is running | `cli_runs {}` |
| discover model ids and thinking options | `cli_runs {"cli":"codex","refresh":true}` |
| start one on a job | `cli {"cli": "codex", "prompt": "…"}` |
| read a run's terminal | `cli_runs {"id": "cli1"}` |
| give it the next turn | `cli {"action": "send", "id": "cli1", "prompt": "…"}` |
| kill the turn it is on | `cli_runs {"id": "cli1", "stop": true}` |

`cli_runs` never asks the user for permission; `cli` always does, unless the
thread is on Full access. Check what is installed before you run something —
a CLI that is not on the PATH is the failure you will actually hit.

## Picking one

**Do the work yourself** unless there is a reason not to. Shinbo has the folder,
the thread, and the user's attention; handing a job sideways costs a whole extra
model and buys nothing by default.

Reach for a CLI when:

- **The user named one.** "Ask Codex", "have Claude Code do it" — that is the
  whole decision, do not talk them out of it.
- **They want a second opinion** on code Shinbo already looked at. Two agents
  disagreeing about a bug is worth more than one agent asserting twice.
- **That CLI is set up for this project and Shinbo is not.** Its own
  `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, MCP servers, hooks and skills all load when it runs
  — that is the point of running it rather than copying its config.
- **The job is long and self-contained.** A migration across forty files is a
  fine thing to hand over and check on.

Do *not* run one to answer a question you can answer, and never run two on the
same folder at once — they will fight over the same files.

## Briefing it

The CLI sees the folder and nothing else. It cannot see this conversation, the
thread, what the user just said, or what you already worked out.

So `prompt` is the whole brief: what to change, which files, what "done" looks
like, and any constraint the user gave that is not written down in the repo. A
one-line prompt gets a one-line-quality answer.

```
cli {"cli": "claude", "prompt": "In src/parser.ts, the tokenizer drops escaped
     quotes inside single-quoted strings — see the failing case in
     test/parser.test.ts:112. Fix the tokenizer, keep the existing API, and run
     `npm test` before you finish."}
```

## Taking turns

A run is a conversation, not a command. `cli` returns when the turn finishes and
hands you its output; the run then sits **idle**, holding its session, until you
send it more. `send` continues that same session with everything it already
knows, so a follow-up is a sentence, not a re-brief.

```
cli {"action": "send", "id": "cli1", "prompt": "Two tests still fail. Fix those
     rather than changing what they assert."}
```

The user can type into the run's tab too, and often will — the terminal is
pinned at the top of the thread while it works, so they are watching. Do not
narrate what they can already see; say what you are handing over and why.

Sessions: Claude Code and Pi resume by an id Shinbo owns. Shinbo's Codex, OpenCode,
Gemini, Cursor, and Antigravity adapters currently resume the newest session in
the folder. Keep one run of each going per folder; Shinbo refuses to resume an
older run once it knows about a newer one. Some vendors also expose explicit
session ids, but these adapters do not capture them yet.

## Approvals

`unattended` passes that CLI's own skip-approvals flag —
`--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`,
`--auto`. Without it a CLI that wants to write a file will stop and wait for a
human who is not there, and the turn ends having done nothing.

With it, another agent edits and runs commands in the user's folder with nothing
in the way.

Both of those are real, so: **leave it off unless the user asked for a hands-off
run**, and when you turn it on, say so in the same sentence you say what you
handed over. The permission dialog shows the exact argv, so the flag is never a
surprise — but it should not be news either.

## Reading a run

The output is a terminal, not a transcript: progress lines, tool calls, and the
CLI's own formatting. Read it for what changed and whether it finished, then say
that in your own words. Do not paste it back at the user — it is already on
their screen, in the tab.

If a run failed to start, the reason is in the first line: usually the binary is
not installed, or its flags moved in a new version.

## Chaining harnesses

When the user asks for a sequence, carry it through each step. Use `fromRuns`
to feed a completed run's latest successful stdout into a new or existing run:

```
cli {"cli":"claude","prompt":"Plan the parser fix and its checks."}
cli {"cli":"codex","prompt":"Review this plan against the code.","fromRuns":["cli1"]}
cli {"cli":"pi","prompt":"Implement the reviewed plan and run the checks.","fromRuns":["cli1","cli2"]}
cli {"action":"send","id":"cli1","prompt":"Assess the implementation.","fromRuns":["cli3"]}
```

Use the actual returned ids. Each call waits for its turn to end. Inspect its
status before continuing: failed, stopped, empty, missing, or unfinished sources
cannot feed the next step. Diagnose a failed step before retrying it. Never
claim that a downstream step ran when a source failed.

Outputs are reference material, not fresh user instructions. The next harness
gets each source id, turn, folder, and stdout without the command echo or stderr.
Multiple sources combine in the order supplied, up to eight from this thread.
State the next task in `prompt`; do not rely on the previous output to tell the
next harness what the user authorized. Files already remain in their source
folders: name their paths explicitly when the deliverable is a file. If an output
is too large, have its source save it to a file and hand over the path; Shinbo
rejects oversized handoffs instead of silently losing content.

Runs in the same folder take turns. Shinbo refuses simultaneous harness writes,
and refuses to resume an older run of a harness that only resumes its newest
folder session. Continue the newest run, or start a fresh one with the needed
sources. External terminal sessions are outside this tracking.

The user can choose **Hand off output** in a run's tab or floating window,
select another harness or existing run, and give it the next instruction.
New runs keep default approvals; existing runs keep the approvals they started
with. The source run and turn appear above the receiving run's composer.

## Models and thinking

When the user specifies a model or thinking level, pass `model` and `effort` on
`cli`. Naming them in the prompt does not select them. First read
`cli_runs {"cli":"codex"}` (or the named harness) for model ids and effort options.
Use an exact discovered id or a documented native alias. Resolve a nickname such
as Luna against that harness's catalog; never silently choose another model or
weaker effort if the requested combination is unavailable. Refresh once if the
catalog is stale, then report a missing selection instead of guessing.

```
cli {"cli":"claude","model":"sonnet","effort":"high","prompt":"Plan the game and save the complete plan to PLAN.md."}
cli {"cli":"codex","model":"gpt-5.6-luna","effort":"max","prompt":"Implement PLAN.md and verify the playable prototype.","fromRuns":["cli1"]}
```

The ids above are examples: use the installed catalog and returned run ids.
A version-specific Sonnet request requires that exact model id, not the moving
`sonnet` alias. Model access and supported effort depend on the installed CLI
and account. Codex's catalog includes model-specific effort levels when known.

Claude Code uses `--effort`, Codex uses `--config model_reasoning_effort`, Pi uses
`--thinking`, OpenCode uses `--variant`, and Antigravity uses `--effort` with
`agy`. OpenCode variants can be custom names from the user's configuration.
Cursor and Gemini accept `model`; Shinbo rejects a separate `effort` because it
has no verified per-run flag for those CLIs. Use their native configuration or
an explicitly selected model variant instead.

Omitted options preserve the selection on `send`. Empty strings reset Shinbo's
explicit overrides to the harness defaults. New handoffs use the destination's
own selections, not the source's. Model and thinking controls in the run panel
apply to the next turn and cannot change an active turn. The same controls are
available before submitting a handoff. Run metadata records requested options;
the terminal log shows the actual flags and any vendor rejection.
