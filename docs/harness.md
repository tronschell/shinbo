# The harness

`emma-cli` is the coding agent that runs every Emma turn. It is a Zig program in
[`harness/`](../harness), driven over the Agent Client Protocol from
[`desktop/main/harness.ts`](../desktop/main/harness.ts). There is no second
agent loop; a missing binary is a broken install, not a fallback.

fx's agent loop, permission model, hooks, skills, subagents, tool registry, MCP
client, and ACP server are upstream's. The fork's divergences, in short:

| Area | Change |
| --- | --- |
| Name | `fx` → `emma-cli`; `build.zig.zon` fingerprint regenerated |
| Transport | Vercel AI Gateway language-model v3 → OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions |
| Auth | All Vercel and ChatGPT OAuth removed; one env var, `EMMA_PROVIDER_API_KEY` |
| Branding | `fx.sh` links, feedback, upgrade, and telemetry endpoints removed |
| `terminal` args | Two real-world call shapes normalized; per-action required fields |
| `terminal` failures | A non-zero exit reports `stdout` beside `stderr`; test runners print their failure report on stdout |
| `subagent` | Advertised whenever the session supports children, not hidden behind `search_tools` |
| Images | ACP `image` prompt blocks accepted into the turn's attachment catalogue |
| Vision | Model catalogue reads OpenRouter's `architecture.input_modalities`; gate is vision alone, not vision + file input |
| `semantic_search` | A `semantic_grep` session option hands the tool to an external `zg` command, adds a `regex` route, and promotes it to an always-advertised default search |

deleted and everything deliberately kept. Read it before touching a vendored
file.

## Who owns what

The harness owns the agent loop, tool execution, permission gating, hooks,
skills, subagents, and the MCP client for one turn. Emma owns the window, the
Markdown thread, and the answer to every permission question.

Four things Emma keeps away from the harness:

| | Why |
| --- | --- |
| The granted folder | The harness resolves `../` and `~` itself and mutates whatever its policy allows. `callEscapesWorkspace` checks every path-shaped argument against the workspace root first: paths are realpath'd, a path that does not exist yet resolves to its deepest existing ancestor, and anything unresolvable is an escape. Denied in every mode |
| Permission modes | All four of Emma's modes map to the harness's `ask` (`HARNESS_MODE_ID`), so every decision comes back over the wire. Mapping `acceptEdits` → `auto` skipped the folder check; `full` → `yolo` left no floor at all |
| The model | Re-applied every turn rather than trusted to persist in harness settings |
| The context window | The harness recognises a handful of model-id prefixes; Emma has the real number from the OpenRouter catalog |

[`agent-loop.ts`](../desktop/main/agent-loop.ts) is not a loop: it starts and
tracks a run, keeps the durable traces, owns the permission channel and Auto
mode's verifier, and answers four tools from its own records — `threads`,
`read_trace`, `agents`, `advisor`.

## Tools

### The harness's own

Registered in [`builtins/tools.zig`](../harness/src/builtins/tools.zig):
`list_files`, `glob_files`, `grep_files`, `read_file`, `write_file`,
`edit_file`, `delete_file`, `rename_file`, `copy_file`, `create_folder`,
`file_info`, `semantic_search`, `lsp`, `open_file`, `web_fetch`, `terminal`,
`skill`, `install_skill`, `subagent`, `mcp_search_tools`, `mcp_select_tool`,
`mcp_features`, `ask_user_question`, `read_tool_result`, `search_tools`,
`select_tool`, `vision`.

Emma delegates file reading, writing, search, and shell entirely — she ships no
`bash` of her own. `lsp` asks a real language server about one file: nine
actions (`diagnostics`, `definition`, `type_definition`, `implementation`,
`references`, `hover`, `document_symbols`, `workspace_symbols`, `servers`) over
a registry of about fifty servers in
[`core/lsp/servers.zig`](../harness/src/core/lsp/servers.zig), one process per
(server, workspace root) for the life of the CLI. `line` is 1-based and
`symbol` finds the column, converted to LSP's 0-based UTF-16 positions on the
way out.

### Emma's, appended natively

Emma's 27 tools are appended to the same registry as `++ emma_tools.all`, so the
harness advertises and dispatches them and Electron runs them. One shared
implementation, [`tools/emma/bridge.zig`](../harness/src/tools/emma/bridge.zig);
only the spec differs per tool.

| Group | File | Tools |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Threads and agents | [`emma/threads.zig`](../harness/src/builtins/emma/threads.zig) | `threads`, `context`, `plan`, `goal`, `agents`, `read_trace` |
| Task list | [`emma/task_list.zig`](../harness/src/builtins/emma/task_list.zig) | `task_list` — the one Emma tool advertised without a `select_tool` |
| Knowledge | [`emma/knowledge.zig`](../harness/src/builtins/emma/knowledge.zig) | `keep`, `artifact`, `component`, `workflow`, `visualize` |
| System | [`emma/system.zig`](../harness/src/builtins/emma/system.zig) | `cli`, `cli_runs`, `advisor`, `install_mcp`, `computer`, `secret` |
| Extensions | [`emma/extensions.zig`](../harness/src/builtins/emma/extensions.zig) | `write_tool`, `run_tool`, `write_skill`, `write_plugin` |
| Browser | [`emma/browser.zig`](../harness/src/builtins/emma/browser.zig) | `browser` |
| Shortcuts | [`emma/shortcuts.zig`](../harness/src/builtins/emma/shortcuts.zig) | `shortcut` |
| Name collisions | [`emma/overrides.zig`](../harness/src/builtins/emma/overrides.zig) | `memory`, `look_at_image`, `web_search` |

`Registry.lookup` returns the first match, so a duplicate name is a bug.
`memory` goes to Emma (fx's is one `~/.fx/memories.json`; Emma's is a directory
tree under `<userData>/memories`) and so does `web_search` (fx's is dead on the
ACP path — `.web_search_runtime_ready = false`). `web_fetch` stays fx's, already
wired with an artifact store and progress. `vision` stays fx's because the
gateway looks it up **by name** and forces it when a model that cannot see is
handed an image; its advertisement is `.never`. It calls the route in
`EMMA_VISION_*`, which is Emma's own Vision setting — the same model
`look_at_image` asks. Emma's image tool is therefore
`look_at_image`, mapped back to Emma's internal `vision` by
`HARNESS_TOOL_NAMES` in [`main.ts`](../desktop/main/main.ts).

A native tool is registered process-wide, so Emma cannot hide one by omitting it
from a per-turn list. `runEmmaTool` re-applies `toolGate(turn.mode, name,
disabledTools)` before running anything, and `whyUnavailable` answers in words
the model can read — "`cli` needs a connected folder", or that computer use is
not available on this platform.

### Discovery: two tools, then the rest

The base advertisement is `search_tools`, `select_tool`, and `subagent`
(`.always`). `vision` is `.never` — reachable only by the gateway forcing it by
name. Every other registry entry is `.on_select` and costs nothing until asked
for.

- `search_tools {query, limit}` — names and descriptions only, never a schema.
  Default limit 8, hard cap 20, `more_available` when there are more. Scoring is
  per query token, case-insensitive substring: 8 points for a name hit, 1 for a
  description hit, tokens under 3 characters ignored. Scores rather than
  filters; requiring every token to match meant real sentences matched nothing.
- `select_tool {name}` — splices one exact schema into the next model step. No
  preceding search needed. A denied, `.never`, or unknown name answers
  `Tool not found: <name>`.
- `session/set_config_option {configId: "tool_hints"}` — a JSON object string
  `{"<tool name>": "<description>"}`. Each named registered tool is advertised,
  and returned by `search_tools`, with that description instead of its own.
  Unknown names are ignored, the value is capped at 16 KiB and each description
  at 2 KiB, invalid JSON is rejected and leaves the previous hints in place, and
  an empty object clears them.
- `session/set_config_option {configId: "preselect"}` — comma-separated tool
  names. Each named `.on_select` tool is advertised as if it were `.always` from
  the next step on, in addition to the base set. Unknown names are ignored,
  `.never` tools cannot be promoted, and an empty value clears the list. Both
  options are per session, and Emma re-sends them every turn so an experiment
  arm cannot leak into the next one.

This is a prompt-cost mechanism, **not** a security boundary. A hidden tool is
still registered and still runs under exactly its usual permission rules.

### zvec-grep mode

Settings → Harness → zvec-grep mode is an experiment. Off, `semantic_search`
is the harness's lexical ranker, hidden behind `search_tools`. On, every turn
sends `session/set_config_option {configId: "semantic_grep"}` whose value is
one stdio MCP-server-shaped entry (`{name, command, args, env}`): the command
is Emma's own binary run as Node (`ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`) on the downloaded
`@zvec/zvec-grep` CLI, and `env` carries `ZVEC_GREP_EMBEDDING` plus
`ZVEC_GREP_HOME` = `~/.zvec-grep`. That home is passed to every `zg` Emma runs
because the harness child's `HOME` is Emma's own `<userData>/harness`, and
without it the harness would query a second, empty index home. With that set
the harness advertises `semantic_search` always, with a schema and description
that name it the default search covering both of zvec-grep's routes, and adds
one guidance line telling the model to start there and keep `grep_files` for
per-line ERE, counts, and pagination. `query` runs
`zg query --vector <q> --fts <q> --limit <limit> --mode auto --preview short [-g <path>/**]`
(two ranked groups, Q1 vectors and Q2 BM25, kept apart because zvec-grep's
fused hybrid list scored below vectors alone on paraphrase questions in the
embedding bench; `limit` is optional, 7 by default, clamped to 1–25). `regex`
runs `zg query --rg -n --max-count 20 -e <pattern> [-- <path>]`. An absolute
`path` inside the workspace is rewritten workspace-relative first, because
zvec-grep's globs and positionals are relative to the connected folder. Both
run in the workspace under a 45 second deadline. Freshness comes from the
daemon: `--mode auto` reaches it through the shared home, and its watcher
refreshes changed files in the background; no `--refresh wait`, because in
direct mode that blocks the query on a full catch-up index.

A `zg` that exits non-zero reports only the first line of its stderr and
points the model at `grep_files`, so zvec-grep's own "ask the user to build an
index" hint never reaches the model. A timeout says so and points at
`grep_files` too. Output past 256 KB is not an error: the tool returns a note
to narrow the pattern or page with `grep_files`. On success, a
`possibly_stale` status or a `background_refresh` coverage fraction below full
appends one line saying how much of the tree the index covers and that no hits
is not proof the code is absent. An empty value clears the option.

Emma owns the index: the first turn in a connected folder runs
`zg index <folder> --embedding <model> --embedding-concurrency 4` in the
background (`--device metal` on Apple Silicon for the llama.cpp models), writes
`<folder>/.zvec-grep/.gitignore` containing `*` so the index hides itself in
worktrees, submodules, and folders that are not repositories at all, and shows
a ledger under the toggle: one row per folder with its state, the model, local
or hosted, and the files done with the time left, read off zg's `Indexing files: n/m`
stderr lines; zg throttles those to one line every 15 s, so until the first one
arrives the row shows zg's latest `Scanning files…` / `Preparing …` /
`Downloading …` line, and no estimate is shown before 25 files or 10 s. A row
whose `.zvec-grep/` has since been deleted is dropped and reindexed, and a
failed folder is retried at most every 5 minutes. The thread bar shows the same
for the thread's folders as a search-lines button beside the context bar
toggle, with a 2px bar filling under it while indexing and a popup listing the
folders. Changing the model clears that memory and rebuilds on the next turn.
Toggling on starts the `zg` daemon so queries are fast; changing the model
restarts it with the new environment, kills any index still running, and
revokes the workspace grants when the new model is local.
Before `zg server on` Emma writes 48 random hex to `~/.zvec-grep/daemon/token`
(mode 0600, only when missing) and points the daemon at it with
`ZVEC_GREP_SERVER_TOKEN_FILE`, because a daemon started without a token accepts
every request on 127.0.0.1:7999; `zg` clients resolve that same path from
`ZVEC_GREP_HOME`, so Emma's queries and a terminal on the same account keep
working. The daemon and the index children get an allow-listed environment
(`PATH`, `HOME`, `TMPDIR`, `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`, and `ZVEC_GREP_*`) so no
provider key sits in a detached process. Toggling off or quitting stops it.

The picker's "Hosted" group (`hosted/…` ids in `HOSTED_EMBEDDING_MODELS`)
covers OpenRouter's embeddings endpoint plus direct OpenAI and Gemini. zvec-grep
knows one remote backend, `qwen/text-embedding-v4`, which posts an
OpenAI-shaped request to whatever `ZVEC_GREP_ENDPOINT` names and expects 1024 floats
back, so Emma's main process runs a loopback proxy: an `http` server on
127.0.0.1 at a port derived from the data directory (a stable port, because
zvec-grep refuses to reuse an index whose endpoint changed), guarded by a
per-launch bearer token. It rewrites `model` to the upstream id, keeps
`dimensions: 1024` only for OpenAI text-embedding-3, otherwise truncates the
returned vector to 1024 and L2-normalizes it, refuses vectors shorter than
that, and signs the upstream call with the provider key from `process.env`
(`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or `GEMINI_API_KEY`, saved in
Settings → Models). Indexing first grants zvec-grep's workspace authorization
(`zg auth grant --capability embedding --scope workspace`) for that endpoint,
so the harness's plain `zg query` needs no `--allow-remote`; the option env and
the daemon carry `ZVEC_GREP_EMBEDDING`, `ZVEC_GREP_ENDPOINT`, and
`ZVEC_GREP_API_KEY` for the proxy, and no `zg` argv repeats them, because argv
is world-readable. If the proxy cannot bind its port the option stays empty and
the folder fails with the bind error, so the harness never queries whatever
else answers there. A hosted model whose key is missing leaves
the option empty (the agent keeps keyword search) and marks the folder
"Needs <KEY>"; Emma never substitutes another model.

zvec-grep is not shipped inside Emma. Settings → Harness downloads
`zvec-grep-<version>-<platform>-<arch>.tar.gz` from the `zvec-grep-v<version>`
GitHub release, checks it against the `.sha256` asset beside it, unpacks it with
`zlib` and a tar reader that refuses absolute paths, `..` segments and links,
into a temporary sibling that is renamed into
`<userData>/vendor/zvec-grep/<version>/` only once the entry point is there, and
then deletes every other version. That directory is outside the app bundle, so a
Squirrel or macOS update finds it already installed and downloads nothing; the
index homes were already per-user and do not move
(`~/.zvec-grep` for the daemon, `<folder>/.zvec-grep/` per folder), so upgrading
Emma never rebuilds a vector index. Downloading is required in both modes,
because a hosted model still indexes through the same local tool. The card in
Settings shows the phase, the bytes and a Cancel button, and `EMMA_TOOLS_URL`
repoints the origin for a local rehearsal.
`scripts/pack-zvec-grep.mjs` vendors the tree with `scripts/vendor-zvec-grep.mjs`,
pruned to the host platform's onnxruntime binaries, and packs those two assets;
the `tools` workflow runs it on `macos-15` and `windows-2025` and publishes them.
`desktop/shared/zvec-grep.ts` holds the one version constant the script and the
app both read, and the third-party licences travel inside the tarball.

## The ACP wire

Newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 over the child's stdio. Emma spawns `emma-cli
acp` once per workspace directory, at most `MAX_HARNESSES = 4` alive at once
(least-recently-used; `reapHarnesses` never closes one with a call in flight).

- `cwd` is the workspace. The harness derives its workspace root from its own
  cwd at startup and ignores the per-session `cwd`, so the **process** is what a
  run is confined to; `prompt()` refuses a turn whose `cwd` does not match.
- `HOME` is `<userData>/harness`, a profile of Emma's own, so the harness never
  reads the user's `~/.fx`.
- `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` and `EMMA_PROVIDER_API_KEY` are both set from Emma's
  `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`; both names, while the Vercel vocabulary is being removed.
- `EMMA_VISION_MODEL`, `EMMA_VISION_CHAT_URL` and `EMMA_VISION_API_KEY` carry
  Settings → Tools → Vision to the forced `vision` tool, which would otherwise
  ask the session's own endpoint for a model that endpoint has never heard of.
  Unset, the tool keeps its built-in default on the session route. The key
  travels only with its own URL, so a session credential never reaches another
  host. Saving tool settings recycles the idle processes that hold the old
  values.
- `EMMA_REVIEWER_MODEL`, `EMMA_REVIEWER_CHAT_URL` and `EMMA_REVIEWER_API_KEY` do
  the same for the automatic permission reviewer behind `emma-cli --auto`, whose
  built-in slug is an OpenRouter one; on another provider every reviewed call
  would fail the review and be denied. The same pairing rule applies: the key
  travels only with its own URL.

A call is abandoned after `MAX_IDLE_MS` — 30 minutes — of **silence**, not wall
clock; any inbound message refreshes every pending timer. Silence that long means
the process is wedged, so the whole client is failed and closed rather than left
holding a turn no reply will ever end: `harnessClient` then spawns a fresh one
and `session/resume` brings the thread back, the same recovery suspend uses.

Those timers count only the time Emma was awake, which is why suspend needs its
own path. When the operating system suspends the process and takes the model's
socket with it, neither end reads the end of that stream, so the turn would sit
at "searching" for as long as the machine slept. On Electron's `resume`,
`resumeAfterSleep` in [`main.ts`](../desktop/main/main.ts) waits `WAKE_GRACE_MS`
— 45 seconds — for a connection that survived to say something, reading
`Harness.silentFor` (wall clock, unlike the reaper). Whatever is still silent is
closed, which rejects the turn in flight; `runOnHarness` then starts a fresh
process, `session/resume` brings the same session back off disk, and the turn is
prompted to carry on from its last finished step. A run the user stopped is left
stopped.

### Methods Emma calls

`AcpMethod.parse` in [`acp/server.zig`](../harness/src/acp/server.zig) accepts
fourteen:

| Method | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `initialize` | Once per process. `protocolVersion: 1`, `clientCapabilities.fs = {readTextFile: false, writeTextFile: false}`. A second call is an error |
| `session/new` | Takes `cwd` and `mcpServers`, returns `sessionId`, makes it active |
| `session/load`, `session/list`, `session/remove` | Session store |
| `session/resume` | Re-activates a session this process displaced, so a thread keeps its history |
| `session/close` | Flushes usage, drops the active session |
| `session/prompt` | Runs one turn |
| `session/compact` | Folds history. Refused mid-turn |
| `session/set_config_option` | `model`, `mode`, `context_window`, `reasoning_effort`, `context_experiments`, `semantic_grep`, `tool_hints`, `preselect`, `agent_step_limit`, `image_input` |
| `session/set_mode` | `modeId` from [`builtins/modes.zig`](../harness/src/builtins/modes.zig): `plan`, `ask`, `acceptEdits`, `full`. Emma always sends `ask` |
| `session/cancel` | A notification, not a request — cancellation has no reply and must not hang on a wedged peer |
| `session/steer` | Cuts into the running turn: the tool call or model stream in flight is aborted, and the same turn carries on with `content` as its next user message. Refused when no turn is running, over 16 KiB, or more than 8 deep |
| `session/steer_child` | Queues a message for one running subagent by `childId`, not queued behind the active prompt |
| `session/cancel_child` | Stops one running subagent by `childId` |

`session/list`, `session/remove`, `session/prompt`, `session/compact`, and
`session/set_config_option` are refused with "Prompt already in progress" while
a turn is in flight; the rest run beside it.

**One session at a time.** `session/prompt` runs against `state.active_session`
and ignores the `sessionId` the call names, and `session/new` swaps it without
waiting. So `harness.ts` tracks which session is active, resumes a displaced one
before prompting its thread again, and runs one turn at a time per process.

### What comes back

Notifications on `session/update`, written by
[`acp/types.zig`](../harness/src/acp/types.zig):

| `sessionUpdate` | Emma does |
| --- | --- |
| `agent_message_chunk` | `onDelta` — the answer, streamed |
| `agent_thought_chunk` | `onThought` — reasoning, on its own channel |
| `tool_call` | `onToolCall` — the whole call, arguments included |
| `tool_call_update` | `onToolCall` — only what changed, merged over the last full state per `threadId:toolCallId` |
| `plan` | `onPlan` |
| `session_info_update` | `_meta.fx.contextExperiment` (a context lever fired) or `_meta.fx.modelResponseRecovery` (retry and backoff, written to the thinking channel so a run waiting out a 503 is not read as a hang) |
| `available_commands_update` | ignored |

Subagents ride the parent's stream — ACP has no nested sessions. A child tags
its updates with `_meta.fx.child` (`{id, title, state}`) and `childTag` fans
them onto an Emma thread of the child's own. Untagged, a child's words would
land in the parent's durable answer.

A child's `session/request_permission` carries the same tag, so its question is
asked against the child's thread — the dialog names the subagent, and the child's
own run goes to `waiting` while the question is out. Before that tag existed the
child had no route to a front end at all: its request parked in the harness
waiting for the TUI's approval pane, which over ACP is nobody, so a subagent that
hit a gated call sat in `awaiting_approval` forever with nothing on screen.

### One prompt turn

1. `session/set_mode`, then `session/set_config_option` for `model`,
   `context_window`, and `context_experiments`. Experiments go out every turn
   even when all off — the harness holds them per session.
2. `session/compact` if Emma asked for one last turn. Best effort.
3. `session/prompt` with content blocks. Skills, folders, files, and notes ride
   as a separate leading text block, not glued to the user's words.
4. Updates stream; permission requests and Emma-tool calls come back as
   requests.
5. Resolves with `{stopReason, usage: {inputTokens, outputTokens}}`. `usage` is
   an Emma extension — upstream ACP has no such field, and it is the only place
   a turn's real token counts exist on Emma's side.

Stop reasons: `end_turn`, `cancelled`, `refused`, `max_output_tokens`,
`max_model_turns`. `failedTurn` treats `refused` as a failure, because the
harness reports a provider or auth failure as ordinary assistant text and still
resolves the call.

### Permission

`requestAcpPermission` in [`acp/prompt.zig`](../harness/src/acp/prompt.zig)
sends `session/request_permission` with the tool call and three options —
`allow_once`, `allow_always`, `reject_once` — and the prompt thread blocks.
Emma answers `{"outcome": {"outcome": "selected", "optionId": "..."}}` or
`{"outcome": {"outcome": "cancelled"}}`. `parsePermissionDecision` maps
`allow_once` → once, `allow_always` → always, `reject_once` and `cancelled` →
deny, and **anything unparseable → deny**. At most 32 outbound requests may be
pending.

`onPermission` in [`main.ts`](../desktop/main/main.ts), in order:

1. `context.outsideWorkspace` → deny, with a `blocked: <tool> is outside the
   connected folder` step. Not overridable.
2. `full` → allow.
3. `acceptEdits` with `kind === "edit"` → allow. Commands still ask.
4. Otherwise `AgentRuntime.question`, which is where Auto mode's verifier sits.

Options are picked by preferred `kind`, never by list position — one reordering
upstream would turn "Allow once" into a session-wide grant. A denial picks
`reject_once` so the turn carries on with a "no"; cancelling would end the run.
A permission dialog titled `file_mutation` is retitled with the path
(`describePath` reads `path`, `new_path`, `destination`, `old_path`, `source`).

### `_emma/callTool`

Emma's tools read and write Electron's durable stores, so the harness never
executes one. It advertises the tool, checks the arguments are a JSON object,
and writes `_emma/callTool` with `{sessionId, toolCallId, name, arguments}` on
the same outbound registry permission and elicitation use, then blocks. There is
no deadline — connecting a folder or running a thread can take minutes — and the
only way out other than a reply is the user cancelling.

Arguments are embedded rather than re-encoded, so the client sees exactly what
the model wrote. Emma replies with `{"output": "..."}` and nothing else. A tool
that refuses or throws answers with `output` **text**, not a JSON-RPC error: the
model recovers from the first and treats the second as a broken channel. The
error path is only for a request that never named a live thread
(`-32602 Unknown session or tool`). Run plain `emma-cli` with no responder and
an Emma tool answers `This tool is only available inside Emma.`, so the turn
survives.

This replaced a localhost MCP server (`desktop/main/bridge.ts`, deleted) that
cost an HTTP round trip, a bearer token, and a second protocol.

### MCP servers

The user's configured servers are read fresh and passed on `session/new` and
`session/resume` in `HarnessMcpServer` shape. A stdio server is signalled by the
*absence* of a `type`, since the harness rejects `"stdio"` as a transport value;
`harnessMcpServers` in [`capabilities.ts`](../desktop/main/capabilities.ts)
resolves its command against PATH, because the harness rejects a bare name
(`CommandNotAbsolute`). A remote server carries `type` (`http` or `sse`), `url`
and `headers` in place of command, args and env, and `headers` is always sent —
an empty array when the entry has none — because the harness answers
`MissingHeaders` for an absent key. The url and headers are checked harness-side by
`streamable_http`; a refusal there is not a dropped entry — `parse()` propagates
it and `session/new` fails for every thread. So `parseMcpServer` mirrors those
rules and drops the entry first: https only (stricter than the harness's loopback
allowance), no userinfo or fragment in the url, no control bytes in a header
value, no two names differing only in case. A reserved header name (`Content-Type`
and friends, which the transport writes itself) is dropped from the entry rather
than taking the entry with it.

`install_mcp` is still stdio-only: its harness-side spec requires a command, so a
remote server arrives by importing a Claude or Cursor config, not mid-turn.

The harness takes MCP servers only at session creation, so `forgetSession` /
`forgetAllSessions` drop a thread's session and let the next turn build a new
one. That is what makes a mid-turn `install_mcp` mean anything. Only the forward
map is dropped; clearing the reverse routing would silence the running turn.

## Watching the wire

The status line in the sidebar foot is the door onto the harness. It is a
button: it opens a dialog holding every process Emma is keeping, the JSON-RPC
traffic in both directions, and the two things to do when something is wrong.

`Harness` reports each message it writes or reads through the `onLog` dep,
along with stderr and the reason a process stopped. `main.ts` keeps the last
500 lines in a ring buffer and broadcasts each one, so what Emma hands the
agent is readable while a turn runs rather than only after it fails.

Streamed answer chunks (`agent_message_chunk`, `agent_thought_chunk`) are the
one thing left out. They are already the transcript, and logging them would
evict the outbound prompt from the buffer inside a single turn.

The dot reads four states, from `harnessHealth` in
[`harness-log.ts`](../desktop/shared/harness-log.ts):

| State | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| Ready | No process yet. The next turn starts one |
| Online | A process is up and answering |
| Stalled | A turn is in flight and the process has said nothing for two minutes |
| Offline | Every process is dead of something Emma did not ask for. A close Emma performed itself — the reaper, quitting — is `ready`, not a fault |

Two actions sit under the log. **Restart agent** closes every process and clears
the pool, so the next turn spawns a fresh one; a turn in flight is dropped, and
the subagents inside it are told they ended rather than left spinning. **Copy
fix prompt** builds a self-contained brief — the process states, the last forty
wire messages, and where to start reading — for handing to another agent when
the harness is what broke.

## Prompt caching

Every provider's prompt cache is a prefix cache, so the request is laid out so
that the bytes that change sit last. Order, from
[`prompt_context.zig`](../harness/src/core/agent/runtime/prompt_context.zig):
the system prompt, tool guidance, skills, model overlay and static workspace
context; the session-stable half of the runtime context (workspace, cwd, OS,
shell, home, repo identity, permission mode, sandbox, authorized directories),
which the context provider marks `prefix` so it is hoisted here; the durable
history; the turn's user prompt; the turn's own tool calls and results; and only
then the volatile tail (date, git branch and worktree state, tracked changes,
background commands, child deliveries), which is marked `no_cache` and rebuilt
every step. A step therefore shares everything but that small tail with the step
before it, and the next turn shares everything but its new prompt with the last
step of the previous one. Anything in the `prefix` half that does change (a
permission-mode switch, a new directory grant, UTC midnight) costs one history
re-read, the same as before the split, and never recurs per call.

Project instructions follow the same rule. The root `AGENTS.md`, the global
`.fx/AGENTS.md`, and the rules for anything named in the prompt are gathered
once at the start of the turn and ride in the static prefix. Rules for a
directory the model only reaches mid-turn — a first `read_file` under `docs/`
whose folder has its own `AGENTS.md` — are append-only. The gate in
[`orchestrator.zig`](../harness/src/core/agent/runtime/orchestrator.zig) holds
the selected block until the step's tool results are in, then appends it to the
content of the last of those tool results, after two newlines. Nothing is
inserted into the prefix, so the bytes before history are identical on every
step of a turn and from turn to turn.

Riding inside the tool result is what makes it durable. `ExecutionMemory` is
built from the same message content, and the history projection sends
`result.output` back verbatim — including for a result large enough that its
output is already a `<tool_result_preview>` wrapper — so the next turn replays
the block from history at the byte offset it had in the turn that found it. At
the start of every turn `seedDeliveredScopedRules` scans the persisted tool
results for `<scoped-rules from="…">` and seeds those paths into
`DeliveryState`, so a later turn that touches the same directory selects
nothing and appends nothing. Within a turn `DeliveryState` already stops a
source from rendering twice. Compaction that drops the turn carrying a block
drops the seed with it, and the next touch renders it again into a new tool
result.

The history budget in [`session.zig`](../harness/src/core/session/session.zig)
trims contiguously from the oldest turn and remembers the oldest turn it kept
(`history_budget_floor`, a fingerprint held on the session). While the tail
from that turn still fits, the kept set only grows, so the trim banner and the
history bytes after the static prefix stay identical turn to turn. When the
budget is exceeded the tail is cut back to three quarters of it, so a long
session pays one prefix miss per several turns rather than one per turn.

Two more things keep the prefix bytes still. The MCP catalog in
[`model_catalog.zig`](../harness/src/core/mcp/model_catalog.zig) renders a
server that is still discovering as ready and never renders tool counts, so
the catalog does not change as servers come up. And a dynamic tool the model
selected with `mcp_select_tool` stays advertised for the rest of the session
(`sticky_dynamic_tools` on the session runtime), so the tool list stops
changing from turn to turn. A subagent advertises the same tool list as its
parent for the same reason, and shares the parent's cached prefix.

For hosts that need explicit markers (Anthropic models through OpenRouter),
[`gateway_json.findCacheMarks`](../harness/src/core/gateway/gateway_json.zig)
places up to three: one on the last leading system message with a one-hour
TTL, so the static prefix survives both a history miss and a pause between
turns; one on the last durable-history message before the turn's prompt, which
is the same bytes for every step of the turn; and one on the last cacheable
message before the overlay, which moves forward each step. Nothing after a
`no_cache` message is ever marked. For OpenAI-shaped hosts that cache automatically (OpenRouter,
`api.openai.com`, any loopback gateway including Emma's ChatGPT relay) the
request carries a
`prompt_cache_key` derived from the session id, the same opaque hash as the
`x-session-id` affinity header, so consecutive steps land on the same cache.

Z.AI (`api.z.ai`) strips the previous turns' `reasoning_content` server-side
unless told otherwise, and regenerates the chain of thought from scratch on
every step, which burns quota and moves the prefix. So requests to that host
carry `"thinking":{"type":"enabled","clear_thinking":false}`, a `user_id` set to
the same opaque session hash as `prompt_cache_key`, and every assistant message
that has reasoning carries it back as `"reasoning_content"`. The bytes have to
be the same in both places a step is sent from, so `reasoning` rides on
`ChatMessage`, on the within-turn suffix built in
[`tool_batch.zig`](../harness/src/core/agent/runtime/tool_batch.zig), and on the
durable `ToolExecutionStep` the session writes and replays. The session file
keeps `schema_version` 3 and gains a `reasoning` key on a tool step only when
there is one, so a step without reasoning encodes exactly as before. The final
assistant message of a turn is never replayed within that turn, so its reasoning
is not persisted. No other host sees any of this.

A `reasoning_details` value on a streamed delta is kept as raw JSON on the
completion and on the assistant message, and echoed back verbatim to
`127.0.0.1` and `localhost` for the ChatGPT relay. It lives only for the turn.

The automatic permission reviewer in
[`auto_classifier.zig`](../harness/src/core/permissions/auto_classifier.zig)
sends its ~16 KB instruction as the first message, a system one, and only then
the request being reviewed and the pending call. It used to send them the other
way round, which made every review a cold prefix.

The ChatGPT relay in [`chatgpt.ts`](../desktop/main/chatgpt.ts) keeps only the
leading system messages in `instructions`; a system message after the
conversation becomes a `developer` item at the end of `input`, and the
`session_id` header is derived from the same key rather than drawn fresh per
request, and is repeated as `session-id` and `thread-id` whenever a cache key is
known. `cache_read_tokens` and `cache_write_tokens` in every turn's usage are
the measure of whether this is working.

Because the relay sends `store: false`, the server keeps nothing between steps:
every reasoning item the model produced has to come back with the next request
or the prefix diverges the moment a tool call lands. So the relay captures each
`response.output_item.done` whose item is a `reasoning` item and hands it to the
harness verbatim as a `reasoning_details` array on the assistant delta, once,
ahead of that step's `tool_calls` and finish chunks. An inbound assistant
message carrying `reasoning_details` puts those items straight back into
`input`, immediately before that message's `function_call` items, or before the
message itself when the step called nothing. A harness that drops the field
silently loses reasoning and roughly a third of the cache hits.

`prompt_cache_retention: "24h"` rides along for `gpt-5` through `gpt-5.5`,
`-codex` variants included. From `gpt-5.6` on, that family uses
`prompt_cache_options` instead and the backend rejects retention, so the relay
omits it; a 400 naming `prompt_cache_retention` retries once without it and
stops sending it for the life of the process.

## Limits the code enforces

| Limit | Value | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tool description, to the model | 4 KiB, then `... [truncated]` | `description_max_bytes`, [`gateway_schema.zig`](../harness/src/core/tooling/gateway_schema.zig) |
| Tool result, to the model | 64 KiB | `default_max_tool_result_bytes`, [`tool_result_limits.zig`](../harness/src/core/tooling/tool_result_limits.zig) |
| Tool output in a `tool_call_update` | 200 bytes, UTF-8 safe | `toolUpdateContentText`, [`acp/prompt.zig`](../harness/src/acp/prompt.zig) |
| Emma tool output over `_emma/callTool` | 64 KiB | `MAX_TOOL_OUTPUT_BYTES`, [`harness.ts`](../desktop/main/harness.ts) |
| One JSON-RPC line | 8 MiB | `MAX_LINE_BYTES`, [`harness.ts`](../desktop/main/harness.ts) |
| Tool arguments kept for the transcript | 4096 chars | `rawInput`, [`harness.ts`](../desktop/main/harness.ts) |
| Pending outbound requests | 32 | `max_pending_outbound`, [`acp/server.zig`](../harness/src/acp/server.zig) |
| Live harness processes | 4 | `MAX_HARNESSES`, [`main.ts`](../desktop/main/main.ts) |
| Idle before a call is abandoned | 30 min of silence | `MAX_IDLE_MS`, [`harness.ts`](../desktop/main/harness.ts) |
| Grace for a woken connection to prove it lives | 45 s | `WAKE_GRACE_MS`, [`main.ts`](../desktop/main/main.ts) |

The description cap was fx's 1024 and is now 4 KiB, matching
`MAX_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_BYTES` in [`tools.ts`](../desktop/main/tools.ts).
`cappedDescriptionAlloc` truncates silently, and at 1024 `plan` lost its
`update` and `delete` lines. A test in
[`emma_tools.zig`](../harness/src/builtins/emma_tools.zig) fails the build if
any Emma description grows past the cap.

Binary or non-UTF-8 output becomes `binary or non-utf8 tool output omitted`. A
permission-denied result is sent whole, not previewed.

## Standing instructions

Emma does not send her system prompt over the wire. `writeHarnessPrompt` in
[`system-prompt.ts`](../desktop/main/system-prompt.ts) writes a file instead,
read by [`builtins/context.zig`](../harness/src/builtins/context.zig) out of
the `HOME` Emma gives the child:

| File | Is |
| --- | --- |
| `.fx/system-prompt-<hash>.md`, named in `EMMA_SYSTEM_PROMPT` | The resolved Settings prompt, in place of the agent's own. `systemPrompt()` reads it at the top of each turn and appends its `# Tools and verification` section back under it — that section is not replaceable, because an agent never told to call `search_tools` cannot reach a single tool. An empty or missing file leaves the built-in prompt whole. `.fx/system-prompt.md` is the fallback when the variable is unset. |
| `.fx/AGENTS.md` | Written empty. Kept improvements loaded here as `<global-rules>` until they moved into the prompt file. |

It is rewritten per turn, so a kept improvement, a scoped preset and a per-turn
A/B arm all ride it directly.

Skills work the same way — see
[plugins.md](plugins.md#bundled-skills) for `mirrorSkillsToHarness`.

## `harness/src/` map

| Directory | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `acp/` | The JSON-RPC server: `server.zig` (dispatch, session state, outbound registry), `prompt.zig` (one turn), `sessions.zig`, `types.zig`, `jsonrpc.zig`, `mcp_servers.zig` |
| `builtins/` | The registries: `tools.zig`, `emma_tools.zig` + `emma/`, `modes.zig`, `skills.zig`, `hooks.zig`, `mcp.zig`, `commands.zig`, `context.zig` (the built-in prompt, `system-prompt.md` and `AGENTS.md`) |
| `core/` | Everything with state: `agent/runtime/` (the loop), `tooling/`, `permissions/`, `session/`, `mcp/`, `lsp/`, `skills/`, `hooks/`, `subagent/`, `workspace/`, `terminal/`, `execution/` |
| `gateway/` | Provider transport only. `emma_openai.zig` holds `default_chat_url` and `chat_url_env` |
| `tools/` | Implementations. Specs live in `builtins/tools.zig`, not here |
| `ui/` | The terminal front end. Emma never sees any of it |

`main.zig` is the composition root. The `wasm_*` and `napi_*` entry points serve
upstream's `libfx` package in [`harness/sdk/`](../harness/sdk), which Emma
neither builds nor ships.

## Building and testing

Zig 0.16.0, declared as `minimum_zig_version` in `harness/build.zig.zon`. The
harness declares no Zig package dependencies.

```sh
npm --prefix desktop run build:harness   # the one script
(cd harness && zig build)                # the same thing
(cd harness && zig build test)           # the only Zig test suite in the repo
```

`build:host` chains it after `emma-host` — so `npm run dev` and `npm start`
reach it that way — and the package scripts run `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe`
inline. Nothing else builds `emma-cli`: `npm run build` and `npm run check` do
not, so a stale binary survives both. A checkout uses `harness/zig-out/bin/emma-cli` on macOS or
`harness/zig-out/bin/emma-cli.exe` on Windows (`DEV_BINARIES` in `main.ts`); a
packaged app has it in its resources directory (`Emma.app/Contents/Resources/`
on macOS, `resources/` on Windows).

### Against a fake provider

[`harness/scripts/mock-openai.mjs`](../harness/scripts/mock-openai.mjs) is a
stand-in Chat Completions endpoint that checks the request shape and drives one
real round trip, so the transport can be proven with no credential and no
network:

```sh
node harness/scripts/mock-openai.mjs 8099 &
EMMA_PROVIDER_API_KEY=anything \
EMMA_PROVIDER_CHAT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8099/v1/chat/completions \
  harness/zig-out/bin/emma-cli acp
```

On Windows, use `harness/zig-out/bin/emma-cli.exe acp`.

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `EMMA_PROVIDER_API_KEY` | The only credential source. There is no sign-in surface |
| `EMMA_PROVIDER_CHAT_URL` | Read by `chatUrl()` in [`gateway/emma_openai.zig`](../harness/src/gateway/emma_openai.zig). Unset falls back to `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`. Also points at a local llama-server |
| `EMMA_OPENROUTER_ZDR` | Any non-empty value adds OpenRouter's `data_collection: "deny"` and `zdr: true`. Opt-in, because most free endpoints offer neither |
| `EMMA_UPGRADE_BASE_URL` | Loopback E2E override only; emma-cli ships inside the app and has nothing to self-update from |
| `EMMA_STREAM_SILENCE_MS` | How long a provider call in [`gateway/emma_openai.zig`](../harness/src/gateway/emma_openai.zig) may deliver nothing at all before the attempt is abandoned with `error.Timeout`, which reaches the recovery policy as an interrupted response and is retried like any other. Default 180000; `0` waits forever |

Larger suites: [`harness/tests/e2e/`](../harness/tests/e2e) (TypeScript, `bun
test`, spawns the built binary with a fake key and never reaches a provider;
every root `*.test.ts` must be classified in `harness/scripts/pgso/corpus.json`
or CI rejects it), [`harness/tests/evals/`](../harness/tests/evals)
(model-backed, needs a real key), and
[`harness/benchmarks/`](../harness/benchmarks).
