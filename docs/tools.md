# Tools

Two separate catalogs reach a turn. **Emma's own tools** run in Electron and are
gated by [permissions.ts](../desktop/shared/permissions.ts). **The harness's
builtins** run inside `emma-cli` and are gated over the ACP permission channel.
They are different lists with different names; do not conflate them.

## Emma's tools

The 27 names in `AGENT_TOOLS`. Schemas are in
[tools.ts](../desktop/main/tools.ts); `runEmmaTool` in
[main.ts](../desktop/main/main.ts) checks the gate and dispatches. Gate column:
`ask` means a dialog in `ask`/`acceptEdits`, the verifier in `auto`, and through
in `full`; `auto` means it never stops. `app approval` is an explicit human grant
for each running app per turn, in every mode. Full matrix in
[permissions.md](permissions.md).

| Tool | What it does | Gate | Implemented in |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `browser` | Drives a real Chrome, mirrored in the browser pane. `snapshot` returns an accessibility tree with `@e1` refs; later actions take a ref or a CSS selector. | ask | [browser.ts](../desktop/main/browser.ts) |
| `cli` | Runs Claude Code, Codex, Pi, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Cursor or Antigravity CLI in a connected folder with explicit model/thinking options and output handoffs. Needs a folder. | ask | [cli.ts](../desktop/main/cli.ts) |
| `cli_runs` | Lists installed CLIs and every run, reads one run's output, or stops its turn. | auto | [cli.ts](../desktop/main/cli.ts) |
| `computer` | Reads and operates approved macOS or Windows apps through accessibility or UI Automation, in the background, and opens an installed app that is not running. No global pointer, screenshots or clipboard. | app approval | [computer.ts](../desktop/main/computer.ts) |
| `shortcut` | Binds a Quick Action prompt to a global keyboard shortcut, in Electron accelerator form. Matching an existing label or combination replaces that slot; there are three. | auto | [main.ts](../desktop/main/main.ts) |
| `write_skill` | Records a durable lesson as `<userData>/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`. | auto | [capabilities.ts](../desktop/main/capabilities.ts) |
| `write_tool` | Writes an executable script into Emma's data folder, callable later by name. `code` must start with a `#!` line. | auto | [capabilities.ts](../desktop/main/capabilities.ts) |
| `write_plugin` | Packages skills as a ChatGPT/Codex plugin and installs it on the Plugins page. | auto | [marketplace.ts](../desktop/main/marketplace.ts) |
| `run_tool` | Lists and runs the tools `write_tool` wrote. Runs in the thread's connected folder. | ask | [capabilities.ts](../desktop/main/capabilities.ts) |
| `memory` | Emma's own `/memories` directory, carried between conversations. Commands: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `delete`, `rename`. | auto | [memory.ts](../desktop/main/memory.ts) |
| `advisor` | Forwards the whole transcript to a stronger model and returns its answer. Takes no arguments — the agent chooses when, never what it sees. | auto | [advisor.ts](../desktop/main/advisor.ts) |
| `vision` | Asks a vision model one question about one image, by `path` or `url`. **Advertised to the model as `look_at_image`.** | auto | [vision.ts](../desktop/main/vision.ts) |
| `secret` | Runs `command` on this computer and sends its output to the model set in Settings → Models under Secrets, with one question. Only that model's answer comes back; the output never enters the thread. | ask | [secret.ts](../desktop/main/secret.ts) |
| `web_search` | Query out to the configured provider; returns ranked titles, links and snippets. | auto | [web-search.ts](../desktop/main/web-search.ts) |
| `task_list` | Tracks one complex job as a durable Markdown tree of tasks and subtasks. Actions: `read`, `write`, `update`, `delete`. | auto | [task-lists.ts](../desktop/main/task-lists.ts) |
| `plan` | Breaks a job into steps in a durable markdown file and hands each to its own subagent; independent steps run at once. Actions: `read`, `write`, `run`, `update`, `delete`. | auto | [plans.ts](../desktop/main/plans.ts) |
| `goal` | The one objective this thread keeps working at, and the ledger under it. Actions: `set`, `get`, `update`, `extend`, `clear`. A subagent's call acts on its parent's goal. See [goals.md](goals.md). | auto | [main.ts](../desktop/main/main.ts) |
| `threads` | Emma's threads: `spawn`, `list`, `read`, `message`, `rename`. | auto | [agent-loop.ts](../desktop/main/agent-loop.ts) |
| `read_trace` | Reads past runs, nested: model identities, the recorded system prompt, skills, tool settings, applied changes, calls, arguments and outcomes. `offset` pages back through older traces. | auto | [agent-loop.ts](../desktop/main/agent-loop.ts) |
| `context` | Reads how full this thread's context window is; `compact: true` folds earlier turns into one summary from the next turn on. | auto | [main.ts](../desktop/main/main.ts) |
| `keep` | Saves one Markdown note into the user's vault. Replaced the old knowledge-save tool. | auto | [vault.ts](../desktop/main/vault.ts) |
| `agents` | Lists what is running now; sends a message into a live run or stops it. | auto | [agent-loop.ts](../desktop/main/agent-loop.ts) |
| `install_mcp` | Adds an MCP server to Emma's config; the harness connects it on the next turn. | ask | [capabilities.ts](../desktop/main/capabilities.ts) |
| `workflow` | Builds and runs the Scheduled tasks: a trigger plus a node graph. | ask | [workflow.ts](../desktop/shared/workflow.ts) |
| `artifact` | Documents, code, pages, drawings and apps on the Artifacts page. Actions: `list`, `get`, `create`, `update`, `rewrite`. No delete. | auto | [artifacts.ts](../desktop/main/artifacts.ts) |
| `component` | Widgets in Emma's own interface, built into the context bar. Actions: `list`, `get`, `create`, `rewrite`. No delete — the user switches one off or removes it from the ⋯ in its header. | auto | [components.ts](../desktop/main/components.ts) |
| `visualize` | Draws one self-contained HTML document inline in the conversation. Nothing is saved. | auto | [visuals.ts](../desktop/main/visuals.ts) |

### Availability, beyond the gate

`toolNeeds` marks two tools conditional. `cli` needs a connected folder; without
one the call answers *"cli needs a connected folder."* `computer` needs a
supported macOS or Windows host; elsewhere it answers that computer use is not
available on this platform. Both are checked in `whyUnavailable` after the gate.

Settings → Tools can switch any tool off, which makes it `hidden` in every mode.
`run_tool` is finer-grained: a single written tool is disabled by the key
`run_tool:<name>`.

### Shapes worth knowing

- `computer` — `list_apps` returns running-app metadata without an app grant.
  `launch_app` takes an installed app's `name` (`Notepad`, `Google Chrome`), never
  a path; it asks for one approval, starts the app outside any job object Emma
  owns, returns its identity and PID, and grants control of that instance for the
  turn. Use it instead of asking the user to open something, and never start a
  GUI app from `terminal`. `get_app_state` asks for the exact app before returning
  accessibility text, a snapshot and element indices. `click`, `set_value`, `type_text`, `key` and
  `scroll` require that app's single-use snapshot and an element index. Snapshots
  expire after 60 seconds. App approval belongs only to the active parent turn;
  delegated harness agents cannot use `computer`. Menu bars are excluded, and
  grants never persist across turns. Full behavior and unsupported controls in
  [computer-use.md](computer-use.md).
- `keep` — `kind` is `page` | `note` | `selection` (a `screenshot` note exists but
  is not a tool argument). No arguments at all keeps the page in front of the
  user. The note lands immediately; a small model fills in title and tags a moment
  later, so do not call twice for the same thing.
- `plan` `steps` is a **JSON array inside a string**:
  `[{"id":"survey","title":"…","brief":"…","tasks":["src/net"],"needs":[]}]`.
  `needs` is the shape; two steps with the same `needs` run together. Rewriting
  keeps status and ticks for steps that keep their id.
- `task_list` `tasks` is a nested **JSON array inside a string**:
  `[{"id":"build","title":"Build it","subtasks":[{"id":"test","title":"Test it"}]}]`.
  Rewriting keeps the status of every task whose id remains.
- `workflow` `trigger` is a five-field UTC cron, `manual`, `after <job-id>`, or
  `on <event>`. `permissionMode` offers `ask` | `acceptEdits` | `full` only.
- `artifact` `surface` (`navbar`, `chat`, `notch`, `context`, `none`) replaces one
  whole region of Emma's own interface live, from a `code`/`js` artifact exporting
  `(api) => Component`. Adding something *new* to the interface is `component`
  instead, and is not an artifact.
- `component` builds into the context bar and nowhere else, which is enforced in
  main rather than asked for. Same module contract as a region —
  `export default (api) => Component`, no imports, no JSX — plus `fetch` and the
  `variables` it declared. Credential-bearing requests require native approval
  of the exact fixed-URL template; widget IDs are not isolated identities.
  Each `rewrite` bumps the version so the mounted
  copy reloads in place. `expand` gives it a ⤢ that opens it over the window. See
  [components.md](components.md).
- `visualize` and `artifact` writes lead with a `[visual:id]` / `[artifact:id]`
  token that Emma uses to render them. Leave it in place.

## The harness's builtins

A different list, in a different process. `harness/` is Emma's fork of
[vercel-labs/fx](https://github.com/vercel-labs/fx) (Apache-2.0, Copyright Vercel,
Inc. and fx contributors; provenance in [FORK.md](../harness/FORK.md)). Specs are
`ToolSpec` values in [tools.zig](../harness/src/builtins/tools.zig). These are the
file, search and shell tools — Emma has none of her own.

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `read_file` | One UTF-8 text file, line-numbered, with optional `start_line`/`line_count`. |
| `write_file` | Create or overwrite with complete contents. |
| `edit_file` | Replace one exact `old_string` occurrence with `new_string`. |
| `delete_file` | Delete a file or empty directory. |
| `rename_file` · `copy_file` · `create_folder` · `file_info` | Move, copy, mkdir -p, and stat. |
| `list_files` | One directory level, no contents. |
| `glob_files` | Paths matching a glob; `mode=count` for counts without listing. |
| `open_file` | Open a file in the OS default app for the user. |
| `grep_files` | POSIX extended regular expression, matched per line: alternation, character classes, anchors, groups, `{m,n}`. No backreferences, lookaround, lazy quantifiers or the `\d`/`\w`/`\s` shorthands. Modes for lines, files-with-matches or counts, with `head_limit`/`offset`. |
| `semantic_search` | Lexical keyword ranking over workspace files by default. With Settings → Harness → zvec-grep mode on, it is answered by [zvec-grep](https://github.com/zvec-ai/zvec-grep), downloaded on demand into Emma's data folder rather than shipped in the app, and advertised as the default search: `query` returns two ranked groups with snippets, Q1 by vector similarity and Q2 by BM25 keywords, up to `limit` hits each (default 7, clamped to 1-25), and `regex` runs ripgrep over the same folder. Embeddings come from the model picked there: local ones run on this computer, hosted ones (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Gemini) send indexed file contents and queries to that provider through a loopback proxy in Emma's main process. |
| `lsp` | Diagnostics, definition, references, hover, symbols from an installed language server. |
| `terminal` | Runs captured commands and drives durable interactive sessions, with monitors on exit, output, ports, paths. This is the shell. |
| `web_fetch` | Bounded text from a public HTTP(S) URL, returned as untrusted content. |
| `subagent` | Create, inspect, message, relate, configure and control child sessions. `permission_mode` inherits the caller and cannot exceed it. |
| `skill` · `install_skill` | Read an installed skill in bounded chunks; install one from a supported source. |
| `search_tools` · `select_tool` | Search unadvertised tools by name and description, then select one so its schema is advertised next step. |
| `mcp_search_tools` · `mcp_select_tool` · `mcp_features` | The same for configured MCP servers, plus MCP resources, prompts and completion. |
| `read_tool_result` | Read more of a large prior tool result by handle. |
| `ask_user_question` | 1–4 multiple-choice questions, interactive runs only. |
| `memory` · `web_search` · `vision` | Names that collide with Emma's. See below. |

Paths may be workspace-relative or external (absolute, `~/…`, or `../…`);
external access is subject to permission policy, and Emma denies anything outside
the connected folder before the mode is even consulted.

Every mode opens advertising the file workhorses (`read_file`, `glob_files`,
`grep_files`, `list_files`), the search door (`search_tools`, `select_tool`) and,
in every mode that may write, `edit_file`, `write_file`, `terminal` and
`task_list`. The rest is behind a search. That is a prompt-cost mechanism, not a
security boundary. `task_list` is in that set because the system prompt's task
tracking section tells the model when to write one, and a rule the model has to
go searching to obey is a rule it skips.

### The shell `terminal` runs, per platform

`terminal` is the only tool that hands text to a shell, and which shell that is
differs by platform. [`shell_resolver.zig`](../harness/src/core/terminal/shell_resolver.zig)
picks it; [`sandbox.zig`](../harness/src/core/permissions/sandbox.zig) runs it.

| | macOS | Windows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shell | the login shell from `getpwuid` (`/bin/zsh` or `/bin/bash`; anything else falls back to `/bin/zsh`) | `pwsh.exe` if PowerShell 7 is installed under `%ProgramFiles%\PowerShell\7` or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps`, otherwise `System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` |
| `profile: user` argv | `<shell> --login` (bash also `-O expand_aliases`) `-c <command>` | `<shell> -NoLogo -NonInteractive -Command <script>` |
| `profile: clean` argv | `<shell> --noprofile --norc` / `-f`, then `-c <command>` | `<shell> -NoLogo -NoProfile -NonInteractive -Command <script>` |
| How the command reaches it | written to the shell's stdin, so nothing is quoted twice | one `-Command` argument, quoted by the CreateProcess rules PowerShell itself parses |
| Exit code | the shell's | see the epilogue below |

`cmd.exe` is not a target. It cannot receive a command containing a double
quote through an ordinary spawn: the C runtime escapes an inner `"` as `\"`,
which `cmd` does not understand, so `dir "C:\Program Files"` fails with *the
filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect* whether or not
`/s` is passed. PowerShell parses its own command line by those same rules, so
the quoting round-trips.

On Windows the command the model wrote is wrapped before it is handed over:

- a one-line prelude sets `[Console]::InputEncoding`, `[Console]::OutputEncoding`
  and `$OutputEncoding` to UTF-8, so non-ASCII output survives instead of
  arriving as `?`. It is one line, so a PowerShell parse error still names a line
  number one off the command the model wrote, not five.
- an epilogue exits with `$LASTEXITCODE` when a native program ran, `0`/`1` from
  `$?` when only cmdlets did. Without it PowerShell collapses every failure to
  `1` and would report a failing cmdlet as success.

The model is told which shell it has: the `shell_path` line of the turn context
([`context.zig`](../harness/src/builtins/context.zig)) is the shell that was
actually resolved, not `$SHELL` or `%COMSPEC%`.

On Windows the command's whole process tree lives in a job object with
`JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`, so everything the command started dies when
the call returns. That is the point: a captured command leaves nothing running.
It also means a GUI app started from this tool — `Start-Process notepad` — appears
and then disappears. The job additionally carries
`JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_BREAKAWAY_OK`, so a child created with
`CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB` can leave the job deliberately; nothing the shell
spawns asks for that, and `Start-Process` does not, so the flag only removes the
kernel's refusal rather than changing what the shell does. Opening a desktop app
is the `computer` tool's `launch_app`, which the `terminal` description says.

`terminal.exec` is stateless on every platform: `cd` in one call does not carry
into the next, because each call starts a new shell in the workspace root. The
durable half of the tool (`start`, `read`, `write`, `wait`, `close`) runs the
same on Windows: the terminal host listens on an AF_UNIX socket through Winsock
and each session is a PowerShell inside a pseudo console; see
[terminal.md](terminal.md).

### The four colliding names

[overrides.zig](../harness/src/builtins/emma/overrides.zig) resolves them, and
`Registry.lookup` returns the first match — a duplicate is a bug, not a fallback.

- **`memory` — Emma's wins.** fx's is one `~/.fx/memories.json`; Emma's is a
  directory tree under `<userData>/memories`.
- **`web_search` — Emma's wins.** fx's is dead on the ACP path, which hardcodes
  `.web_search_runtime_ready = false`.
- **`web_fetch` — fx's wins.** Theirs is wired on the ACP path with an artifact
  store and progress, and carries the untrusted-content warning.
- **`vision` — fx's wins**, because it is not a tool the model picks: the gateway
  looks it up by that exact name and forces it when a model that cannot see is
  handed an image. Emma's image tool is therefore advertised as `look_at_image`.
  Both read one setting: Emma spawns the harness with Settings → Tools → Vision
  in `EMMA_VISION_MODEL`, `EMMA_VISION_CHAT_URL` and `EMMA_VISION_API_KEY`, so
  the forced tool asks the model the user chose over that model's own endpoint
  rather than asking the session's provider for a slug it does not serve.

## How a call reaches an implementation

The agent loop lives in the harness (`emma-cli acp`, see
[harness.md](harness.md)). Emma's tools are registered there as native specs
([emma_tools.zig](../harness/src/builtins/emma_tools.zig)) with
`executor_kind = .emma`, `advertisement = .on_select` (`task_list` alone is
`.always`) and `requires_approval = false`; the harness dispatches them back into Electron over
`_emma/callTool`, which lands in `runEmmaTool`. That function maps the wire name
(`look_at_image` → `vision`), checks `toolGate`, checks availability, parses the
arguments with `parseToolArgs`, raises the dialog on an ordinary `ask` gate, then
runs the call. `computer` instead resolves the app and obtains a human-only grant
inside its implementation, so neither Full access nor the Auto verifier bypasses
it. Before dispatch, the harness bridge rejects child computer calls and calls
without a current parent tool-call ID. Tool results return as one text string —
there is no image channel.

The harness's own tools never leave the harness process; their permission requests
come back over ACP to `onPermission` in [main.ts](../desktop/main/main.ts).
