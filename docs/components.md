# Components

A component is a widget Shinbo writes into her own interface. It is a real module
in the running React tree — the app's stylesheet, the app's bridge, no build step
and no frame — and it reloads in place every time she rewrites it.

Where a component *goes* is not a choice. It goes in the context bar, under the
built-in widgets and inside their chrome (`COMPONENT_ZONE` in
[`desktop/shared/components.ts`](../desktop/shared/components.ts)). Every other
part of the window is outside the supported placement contract: the column owns
the padding, header row and reveal. This is a layout convention, not a security
sandbox. Components execute in the same renderer as the app and can access its
DOM and bridge; treat them as code you are choosing to run.

## The module

```
export default (api) => Component
```

`api` is `{ h, Fragment, useState, useEffect, useMemo, useRef, useCallback, shinbo, fetch, variables }`.
`h` is `React.createElement` — no JSX, nothing to import. The component is handed
one prop, `expanded`.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `shinbo` | The same bridge the app uses: `shinbo.request("snapshot", {})` for threads and jobs, `shinbo.threadTraces(id)`, `shinbo.machineSample()`, and the rest. Everything the app knows, a component knows |
| `fetch(url, init)` | One request through main. `init` is `{ method, headers, body }`; the answer is `{ status, ok, body }`. Fixed public HTTPS only, DNS-checked and pinned; redirects rejected. Responses must be uncompressed UTF-8 text within 1 MiB, with a 20-second timeout |
| `variables` | The environment variable names this component declared, as names. Never the values |

## Variables

Credentials a component needs are declared by environment-variable name when it
is created:

```
component {"action":"create","title":"Linear issues","code":"…","expand":true,"variables":["LINEAR_API_KEY"]}
```

The user fills them in **Settings → Built by Shinbo**, where each component lists
what it asked for. Values go through `CredentialStore` — encrypted by
`safeStorage` and mirrored into main's environment. The credential-list API
returns masked summaries, not full values.

The module writes `{{LINEAR_API_KEY}}` into a header value or body; placeholders
in URLs are refused. Main substitutes only declared, set names. Before sending
credentials it shows a native confirmation for the fixed URL, method, template
and variable names. Approval lasts for that exact template and component version
in the current app session; changing the template, component or credential values
asks again. Keyless requests do not need this credential confirmation.

Declining is remembered for that exact request in the current session too. To
reconsider an unchanged request, restart Shinbo. Approval records are bounded, so
older requests may ask again during a long session.

Widgets share the renderer and full bridge, so a component ID is not an isolated
identity and declarations are not private per-widget credential stores. Approval
authorizes that request, not the trustworthiness of the module or service. The
destination receives the secret. Obvious raw, JSON, URL-encoded and base64
credential echoes are blocked, but a malicious service can transform a secret;
this is not a guarantee against leakage. Review the template and destination,
and do not approve credentials for code you do not trust.

## Full screen

288px is not enough for a table or a board. `expand: true` gives the widget a ⤢
in its header that opens it over the whole window, and hands the component
`expanded` so it can draw both readings — the dense one in the column, the full
one in the sheet. The user turns it on or off themselves from the ⋯ menu or from
Settings; the agent sets it when the thing it is building plainly needs the room.

A component without `expand` has no ⤢ and never opens, so nothing gains a
full-screen mode by accident.

## The reveal

A new version wipes in behind a left-to-right ASCII reveal (`built.css`), drawn
in `--accent-2` — the accent rotated 150° in OKLCH, so it is always a second hue
against whatever accent is set, custom hex included. Both the wipe and the
clip-path fade under it stop at `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## A worked example

Both halves of the contract in one widget: app data through `shinbo`, outside data
through `fetch` with a declared variable, and two readings of the same list.

```js
export default ({ h, useState, useEffect, shinbo, fetch }) => ({ expanded }) => {
  const [issues, setIssues] = useState([]);
  const [threads, setThreads] = useState(0);
  const [error, setError] = useState("");

  useEffect(() => {
    void shinbo.request("snapshot", {}).then((snap) => setThreads(snap.threads.length)).catch(() => setThreads(0));
    void fetch("https://api.linear.app/graphql", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json", Authorization: "{{LINEAR_API_KEY}}" },
      body: JSON.stringify({ query: "{ issues(first: 20) { nodes { identifier title state { name } } } }" }),
    })
      .then((answer) => {
        if (!answer.ok) throw new Error(`Linear answered ${answer.status}`);
        setIssues(JSON.parse(answer.body).data.issues.nodes);
      })
      .catch((reason) => setError(String(reason.message ?? reason)));
  }, []);

  if (error) return h("p", { className: "bar-empty" }, error);
  return h("div", { className: "agent-metrics" },
    h("span", null, h("b", null, String(issues.length)), " open · ", String(threads), " threads"),
    ...issues.slice(0, expanded ? 20 : 5).map((issue) =>
      h("span", { key: issue.identifier }, h("b", null, issue.identifier), " ", issue.title)));
};
```
