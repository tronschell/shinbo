## What this fork changes

Emma keeps fx's agent loop, permission model, hooks, skills, subagents, tools,
and MCP client. It replaces the parts that tie fx to Vercel's hosted services:

- **Model-scoped subagent context.** Native ACP children ask Electron for the
  prompt, tool descriptions, preselected tools and context settings for their
  actual model before calling it. The response is validated and replaces the
  parent's settings. The request also records the child's skill context for
  run analysis. System prompt file reads allow 128 KiB to cover the desktop's
  character limit in UTF-8.
- **Binary and package name.** `fx` becomes `emma-cli`. The `build.zig.zon`
  fingerprint is regenerated, because upstream's own comment on that field says
  a fork that keeps it is attempting to take over the original project's
  identity.
- **Model transport.** Upstream talks to Vercel AI Gateway over the AI SDK
  language-model v3 protocol (`prompt`/`toolChoice` at `/v3/ai/language-model`).
  Emma talks to any OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint, which is the
  provider seam the rest of Emma already uses. Replies stream as
  `text/event-stream` chat-completion chunks, and an endpoint that answers with
  anything else falls back to the buffered body path. Malformed tool-call
  replies and allocation failures release partially parsed calls and completion
  fields exactly once. A router chain arrives as a comma-separated model, and
  OpenRouter refuses a request that names more than three, so the chain's first
  three become the `models` array and the rest are dropped.
- **Windows gateway sockets.** Zig's Windows backend runs a socket read as an
  AFD request that `shutdown` does not abort, so cancelling a stalled turn
  waited for the peer, and it collapses connection refusal, reset, and local
  disconnect into `error.Unexpected`, which the retry classifier could only
  treat as retryable wholesale. On Windows every gateway request runs its
  sockets through `gateway/cancellable_socket_io.zig`, which polls with
  `WSAPoll` and rechecks the turn's cancel flag before each `recv` and `send`,
  and reads `WSAGetLastError` itself, so cancellation lands within a poll
  interval and refusal and reset arrive under their own names. POSIX keeps the
  standard backend unchanged.
- **Authentication.** Upstream's Vercel device OAuth, ChatGPT Codex OAuth, team
  selection, and credit balance are removed. Emma supplies a base URL, a model,
  and the *name* of an environment variable holding the credential; there is no
  vendor login surface anywhere in Emma.
- **Branding and hosted endpoints.** `fx.sh` docs links, feedback and upgrade
  URLs, and telemetry paths are removed rather than repointed.
- **Terminal arguments.** Upstream's `terminal` tool rejects anything that is
  not the exact advertised shape, with one sentence that repeats no matter what
  is wrong, so a model that sends `{"command":"pwd"}` loops until the retry
  guard stops the turn. Emma normalizes the two shapes models actually send —
  a lone `{"request":{...}}` envelope, and a call carrying only a command,
  which runs as `exec` — reads `"None"`/`"nil"`/`"undefined"` as the absent
  field they mean, and names what is wrong when it still cannot run the call.
  Each action's branch requires only its own required fields instead of every
  field it allows, so a command no longer costs two dozen explicit nulls.
  Three further shapes were measured in real traces and now recover: a
  `request` whose value is a JSON-carrying string rather than an object, a
  repeated field where the copies agree or one is null, and an invalid `\|`
  escape, which models write constantly because grep and sed alternation is
  spelled that way in a shell. The escape repair only runs when the original
  failed to parse and the repaired text parses, so it can never rewrite a
  payload that was already valid. A repeat whose copies genuinely conflict
  still fails: last-wins would run a command the model did not ask for.
- **Semantic search.** A `semantic_grep` session option (one stdio
  MCP-server-shaped entry, parsed by the MCP config parser) hands the
  `semantic_search` builtin to an external zvec-grep command, swaps in a schema
  with a `regex` route beside `query` so vector, BM25 and ripgrep are one tool,
  promotes it to `.always` as the default search, and clears back to upstream's
  lexical ranker on an empty value.
- **Tool call titles.** Upstream titles an ACP tool call with the tool's bare
  action label, so every shell call reads `Using terminal` and every read reads
  `Reading` with no path — a column of identical rows that hides what the turn
  actually did. Emma titles each call with the same formatter the CLI already
  used for its own activity lines, so the title carries the command, the path or
  the pattern, capped and with secrets masked.
- **`cwd` instead of `cd`.** The `terminal` schema said only that `cwd` is the
  working directory, so models moved by prefixing `cd` to the command. Thirty-one
  measured calls did that: ten to the exact workspace root, which the default
  already was, and nine set `cwd` and prefixed `cd` anyway — one of them with
  `cwd` at the root and `cd /tmp` in the command. Both descriptions now say to
  set `cwd` rather than prefix `cd`, and that any absolute path is accepted
  subject to permission policy. The default and the policy are unchanged; the
  wording was the whole bug.
- **`grep_files` searches by pattern.** Upstream's is a literal substring
  search and says so in its own description, sending the model to `rg` through
  `terminal` for anything more; measured traces took that route, with
  forty-nine of seventy-nine shell `grep`/`rg` calls carrying a regular
  expression, almost all of them plain alternation. Emma compiles the pattern
  once and hands `git grep` `-E` instead of `-F` whenever it is not a literal,
  so the tracked-file path stays the one process it always was. The paths git
  grep never covers walk in Zig — untracked files always, single-file roots, a
  root git ignores, a workspace that is not a repository, and a machine with no
  git installed — so `src/core/shared/regex.zig` gives that walk the same POSIX
  ERE rather than letting a pattern quietly match as a literal. The two engines
  agree by refusing rather than guessing: every construct where a hand-written
  parser would diverge from glibc is a named compile error, and a pattern that
  slips past anyway and that git grep rejects falls to the Zig walk, which
  answers it. A pattern with no metacharacters keeps the old literal path and
  `-F`, byte for byte. Three ceilings stop a pattern costing the turn: five
  million backtracking steps and two thousand match frames per line, both
  reported by name rather than hung, and sixty-four levels of group nesting,
  refused at compile time because the parser recurses and the pattern is
  written by a model.
- **Subagent advertisement.** Upstream hides the `subagent` tool behind
  `search_tools` (`.advertisement = .on_select`); Emma advertises it whenever
  the session supports children. Delegation is a first-class Emma feature — the
  app draws every child as a thread of its own — and a tool the model has to go
  looking for is one it does not use. The `subagent_available` gate is untouched.
- **Workhorse advertisement.** The same reasoning, applied to the seven tools a
  coding turn needs whatever it was asked to do: `read_file`, `list_files`,
  `glob_files`, `grep_files`, `edit_file`, `write_file` and `terminal` are
  advertised rather than searched for. Upstream defers all of them, and
  `search_tools` ranks by keyword over a default of eight results, so a model
  whose query missed `grep_files` concludes there is no way to search a
  workspace and reads files one at a time instead — hundreds of calls to answer
  what one grep answers. The other eighteen searchable tools are unchanged, and
  they are where the deferral was ever worth its round trip.
- **Per-session tool hints and preselection.** Two config options let a trial
  change what the model sees without a rebuild: `tool_hints`, a JSON object of
  tool name to replacement description applied at advertisement time and in
  `search_tools` results, and `preselect`, a comma-separated list of `.on_select`
  tools advertised as if `.always` for that session. `.never` tools stay
  unreachable, unknown names are ignored, and an empty value clears either one.
- **Lazy MCP startup.** Emma validates and retains ACP MCP configs at session
  creation but defers process startup and discovery until the first MCP search,
  selection, or call. A turn that does not use MCP never starts those servers.
- **Attached pictures.** Upstream's ACP server rejects every `image` prompt
  block, because fx only ever attaches a picture through its own TUI. Emma is an
  ACP client with a composer of its own, so a block naming a local `file://`
  image is loaded into the turn's attachment catalogue instead — the same
  catalogue `/image` fills — and snapshotted into the session's `images`
  directory the way every other surface snapshots one.
- **Model catalogue shape.** Upstream reads `vision` and `file-input` off a
  Vercel AI Gateway model's `tags`. OpenRouter publishes neither; it publishes
  `architecture.input_modalities`. Emma reads both shapes, so a model that can
  see is known to be able to.
- **Native vision gate.** Upstream routes a picture to the model itself only
  when it reports both vision *and* file input, then falls back to the forced
  `vision` tool. Emma gates on vision alone: the native part is an `image_url`,
  file input has nothing to do with it, and on OpenRouter a third of the models
  that can see do not claim it.
- **Vision approval.** A `vision` call naming `image_ids` resolves only against
  the catalogue the user themselves attached, so Emma admits it without a
  prompt. A call naming `paths` is the model choosing a file, and keeps its
  per-path gate.
- **Native Emma tools.** The twenty-seven tools Emma owns are appended to fx's
  registry as `++ emma_tools.all` — specs in `src/builtins/emma_tools.zig` and
  `src/builtins/emma/`, one shared implementation in
  `src/tools/emma/bridge.zig`, and a new `ExecutorKind.emma`. The harness
  advertises and dispatches them but never runs one: `callEmmaTool` in
  `src/acp/prompt.zig` writes an outbound `_emma/callTool` request and blocks
  for the client's reply. They used to reach the model as a localhost MCP
  server, because MCP is the only door upstream leaves open for a tool it does
  not ship. `read_only_tool_names` in `src/builtins/tools.zig` had to gain them
  when they stopped being MCP servers: `Registry.toolAllowed` waves through
  anything the registry does not know, so bridging had made that list
  irrelevant to them.
- **App-scoped computer use.** `computer` advertises running-app discovery,
  accessibility state, and background actions against one exact app instance
  instead of global screenshots, pointer coordinates, and keyboard shortcuts.
  Mutations name an element from a single-use state snapshot. Calls still cross
  `_emma/callTool`; Emma owns the app approval and enforces it only for the current
  parent turn, regardless of full or auto mode. Child agents cannot use computer
  and must ask the parent to perform app actions. There is no
  activation, clipboard, or global-input fallback, and no Codex desktop runtime
  is copied or bundled.
- **Language servers.** `src/core/lsp/` and `src/tools/lsp/` are new — a
  JSON-RPC client with `Content-Length` framing, a process pool keyed by
  (server, workspace root), a data-only registry of about fifty servers in
  `src/core/lsp/servers.zig`, and the `lsp` tool's nine actions. An agent that
  can ask a real language server does not have to guess a definition from text.
- **Skill catalog budget.** `skill_catalog_bytes` defaults to 64 KiB instead
  of upstream's 16 KiB, which omitted `scheduled-tasks` and `threads` once
  imported skills filled the catalog. Per-description limits, explicit catalog
  overrides, and overflow warnings are unchanged.
- **Tool description cap.** `gateway_schema.description_max_bytes` was
  upstream's 1024 and is 4 KiB. `cappedDescriptionAlloc` truncates silently, so
  at 1024 `workflow` lost its last commands with nothing to
  show for it. A test in `src/builtins/emma_tools.zig` fails the build if a
  description outgrows the cap.
- **System prompt per process.** `builtins/context.zig` replaces the built-in
  prompt sections with the file named by `EMMA_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, falling back to
  `$HOME/.fx/system-prompt.md`; the tool contract section is kept either way.
  Emma runs one emma-cli per thread out of a single `HOME`, so each process is
  given its own file rather than racing the shared name.

- **Cancelling one child.** `session/cancel_child` is added beside upstream's
  `session/steer_child`, so Emma can stop a single subagent without cancelling
  the parent turn that spawned it.

- **Multiple edits per `edit_file` call.** Upstream's `edit_file` takes one
  `old_string`/`new_string` pair, so five changes to one file cost five calls,
  five approvals, and five chances for the model to re-read stale content it
  just rewrote. Emma's takes an `edits` array applied against a single
  preimage: every match is located first, overlapping edits are refused by
  name, and the survivors are spliced into one fresh buffer. The flat shape
  still decodes, into a one-element array, because models trained on the old
  one keep sending it. `tool_admission`'s mutation-identity hash folds every
  entry rather than the first pair, or an approved multi-edit call could be
  swapped for a different one.
- **Quoted range arguments.** `read_tool_result` took `start_byte` and
  `byte_count` as bare JSON integers only, so a model sending `"8192"` or `"0"`
  was refused — fifty-four measured failures, the largest single failure class
  in the stored traces. A JSON string that is entirely ASCII digits now decodes
  as that integer, and `start_byte` 0 reads as 1 because the field is 1-based
  and defaults to 1. Everything else still fails with the message it always
  had, and `byte_count` must still be positive.

- **Tool search ranking.** Upstream ranks `search_tools` by keyword overlap,
  which cannot tell a name match from a body match and gives a rare term no
  more weight than a common one. Emma ranks by BM25 over two fields, name
  weighted eight to one against description-plus-schema, with the tokenizer
  splitting on every non-alphanumeric byte so `grep_files` is found by `grep`.
  The index is rebuilt per call; twenty-odd tools do not earn a cache.
  Advertised tools are excluded from the index, which upstream leaves as an
  empty result the model cannot learn from. Emma answers a query that is
  plainly reaching for one with `already_advertised` and a note to call it
  directly. The match is deliberately dumb — every token of at least three
  characters in the tool's name must appear in the query — because a false
  positive here teaches exactly the habit the field exists to break.
- **Bounded parallelism.** Upstream spawns one thread per read-only call in a
  batch and unwinds the whole batch if any spawn fails. Emma runs a fixed pool
  of eight against a work queue that hands out indices atomically, and the
  calling thread works the queue too, so a batch of thirty is thirty tasks over
  eight threads rather than thirty threads.
- **Command timeout default.** Upstream leaves `terminal exec` unbounded.
  Emma defaults to ten minutes — this is the path a real build or test suite
  takes, so a ten-second ceiling would fail honest work — and the timeout
  message names `terminal action:"start"` with a `wait_ceiling_ms` as the way
  to run longer than that.
- **Foreground output drain ceiling.** Upstream's post-signal drain loop bounds
  each read but not the loop. A descendant that escapes the process group with
  `setsid` holds the inherited pipes open, every read times out, and the loop
  spins forever with the agent wedged behind it. Emma stops draining two
  seconds after the signal was sent.
- **Step limit default.** `max_agent_steps` defaults to 1000 rather than
  upstream's 0. The enforcement and its notice already existed; only the
  default was unbounded, which meant a model in a tool loop had nothing to stop
  it. Zero still means unbounded for anyone who wants it.
- **Repeated-call containment.** Upstream stops an agent on a repeating tool
  call cycle and on consecutive all-error steps; the migration dropped both,
  leaving the step cap as the only brake, and observed threads spent whole
  steps re-reading a file already in context. Emma blocks the third identical
  read-only call in a turn — same tool, byte-identical arguments — and returns
  a tool result saying so rather than stopping the agent. Any write between the
  repeats clears the count, so read, edit, re-read is untouched.
- **Streamed response ceiling counts generated bytes.** The 4 MB response cap
  summed whole SSE frames, so per-chunk `id`, `model`, and `created` framing
  counted against it. On OpenRouter that framing is most of the stream, and a
  turn died with `ResponseTooLarge` at roughly sixteen thousand reasoning
  tokens, discarding every tool result it had earned. The cap now counts only
  content, reasoning, and tool-argument bytes.
- **Both selection doors agree.** `select_tool` on an already-advertised tool
  answers "is already available; call it directly." `mcp_select_tool` did not:
  the same name came back as "not found or not allowed", which reads as an
  error to fix rather than a step to skip, so the model searched again. Both
  doors now give the same answer, and a name beginning with `mcp_` sent to the
  native door is pointed at the MCP one instead of failing as unknown, which
  cost three consecutive retries of one name in the traces.

- **Failure messages name the cause, not the gate.** Upstream reports a
  permission target that cannot be resolved as `Permission target resolution
  failed for <tool>: <error>`, so a path that simply does not exist is
  indistinguishable from one the user denied, and the model retries rather
  than adapting. Emma splits the five cases apart, states that a missing or
  out-of-workspace path is not a permission denial, and names the next tool to
  reach for. The same reasoning was applied to the other measured retry loops:
  a range field that arrived as a quoted string says so rather than talking
  about the value's sign, a glob passed as `path` is named as that mistake,
  and `vision` given a text file is told to use `read_file`. A field the tool
  does not have is refused rather than dropped in silence: `read_tool_result`
  answers an `end_byte` with the arithmetic for the `byte_count` it wants,
  because a range the model believes it set and did not is a loop it cannot
  see. The terminal action correction carries the same instruction to act on,
  telling the model to drop the fields that belong to another action rather
  than keep resending them with different values.

- **Model-written compaction.** Upstream compacts history by deterministic
  extraction. Emma asks the model for a structured handoff note — goal,
  constraints, progress, decisions, next steps — and updates that note
  iteratively as the session grows, carrying read and modified file lists
  across compactions. The call is bounded at thirty seconds against the turn's
  own cancel flag, and *any* failure — unconfigured, transport, timeout,
  cancel, empty, or unstructured output — falls back to upstream's
  deterministic summary. Only the ACP path is wired; `main.zig` and `cli_ask`
  stay deterministic.

- **History budget from the session's own window.** The projected history budget
  divided the model catalog's context window, and a provider model has no
  catalog window, so every request carried a quarter of upstream's 24k default
  no matter how large the real window was, and turns fell out of the projection
  in silence. The budget now divides the same merged window `experimentSettings`
  already uses — the window the host set over ACP unless it is zero, else the
  catalog's — and `shouldAutoCompact` measures its trigger percent against that
  budget rather than the whole window, so the summary is written and announced
  before anything is dropped. `compact_percent = 0` still means off.

- **History invariant repair.** Every provider request assembles through
  `buildGatewayMessages`, which now inserts a synthetic result for any tool call
  the history leaves unanswered. Upstream holds the invariant at construction
  time and mostly succeeds — unpaired calls are dropped before they persist, and
  an interrupted turn's in-flight call already projects with an `aborted by
  user` result — but a session persisted with unpaired calls decodes without
  complaint, and a cancelled parallel batch leaves a dangling call that only a
  re-read of the cancel flag catches. The repair is idempotent and a well-formed
  history comes out byte-identical. No derived id is needed: a tool message is
  identified solely by `tool_call_id`, so the synthetic message is a pure
  function of the call it answers.

### De-Vercel pass (removals)

Commands and their plumbing: `login`, `logout`, `teams`, `credits`, `setup`, the
ChatGPT/Codex OAuth flow (`src/core/auth/chatgpt_oauth.zig`), and `/feedback`.
The credential model collapsed to a single source read from
`EMMA_PROVIDER_API_KEY` (`src/core/auth/credentials.zig`), and
`model_provider.ProviderId` to a single `gateway` variant.

Modules deleted: `src/builtins/devbox.zig` and
`src/core/execution/devbox_executor.zig` (Vercel Sandbox remote execution),
`src/core/hosts/native_secret_store.zig`, `src/core/feedback/runtime.zig`. The
gateway-API-key and OAuth-session halves of `src/core/hosts/native_keychain.zig`
went with them; the MCP OAuth half stays, because `src/core/mcp/` uses it.
`BackendKind.vercel` is gone from `src/core/shared/types.zig`, and the sandbox
`vercel` backend from `src/core/permissions/sandbox.zig`.

Release and hosting infrastructure: the Vercel Blob CDN workflows
(`cdn-backfill.yml`, `release.yml`, `dev-release.yml`, `prepare-release.yml`,
`publish-libfx.yml`). `upgrade_helpers.resolveCdnBase()` now returns `null`
unless the loopback E2E override is set, because emma-cli ships inside the
desktop app and has nothing to self-update from.

`EMMA_PROVIDER_CHAT_URL` now also accepts any HTTPS endpoint, not just a
loopback HTTP one. Emma points emma-cli at whichever provider host a plan or
custom profile names, so the upstream loopback-only rule sent every one of them
to OpenRouter instead. Cleartext HTTP is still refused off loopback, so the
bearer token never travels unencrypted, and the credential is read from the same
environment that sets this URL — anyone able to redirect the endpoint can
already read the key.

Renames: `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` → `EMMA_PROVIDER_API_KEY`,
`FX_E2E_UPGRADE_BASE_URL` → `EMMA_UPGRADE_BASE_URL`, `fx` → `emma-cli` in help,
usage, and error text, `fx.shared_model_context.v1` →
`emma.shared_model_context.v1`, and the `ai_gateway_*` web-search backend ids to
`perplexity_search`/`parallel_search` (local selector labels; the wire tool name
was already unprefixed).

Deliberately kept: the `LICENSE`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, and every Apache-2.0
header and copyright line; `sandbox.retired_sandbox_config_message` and its
`vercel` parse arm, so an existing config naming that sandbox gets a real
diagnostic instead of a silent fallback; `"VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN="` in the
`secret_prefixes` redaction allowlist in `src/core/shared/text_utils.zig`, since
dropping an entry only weakens redaction; the `~/.fx` config paths and `FX_*`
environment variables, which are fx branding rather than Vercel and are
user-settable; `sdk/`, upstream's `libfx` package, unrenamed and still pointing
at `vercel-labs/fx`, because Emma neither builds nor ships it — `build.zig.zon`
`.paths` does not list it and the WASM and N-API artifacts are opt-in build
options; and inert fixture strings naming `vercel-labs/agent-skills`,
`github.com/vercel-labs/fx` git remotes, and `vercel/v0` PR URLs.

Unused web-search aliases, tool-label forwarding helpers, legacy catalog-fetch
entry points, and unused failure-formatting helpers are removed. Catalog HTTP
coverage calls the active provider directly. The permanently skipped GLM request
header test is removed; the JavaScript-host request builder remains intact.

## Merging upstream

Upstream is under active development, so this fork is a real maintenance cost —
that was a deliberate, accepted trade. Keep changes minimal and localized so a
future `git diff` against a newer upstream tag stays readable. Anything Emma
adds that is not a de-Vercel change belongs in Emma's own code where possible,
not scattered through vendored files.

Upstream is not merged wholesale. Between `580a0c5` and `c864c677` it landed 201
commits over 295 files, and a trial three-way merge conflicted in 82 of them —
almost all in the auth, provider, setup, and TUI surfaces this fork deleted.
Upstream also grew a Grok and Codex OAuth surface, which contradicts the rule
that there is no vendor login anywhere in Emma. So commits are taken one at a
time, each one built and tested before the next.

### Taken from upstream since the fork point

Upstream SHAs, in the order they were applied. Each landed as its own commit
here, so `git log` in this directory maps one to one.

| `b199b8e` | Reduce MCP catalog memory |
| `16aa069` | Use bounded MCP search match storage |

Two carry Emma-side changes rather than a straight apply. `a585697` says a
terminal call must never pass an array; that sentence is kept, but the
surrounding paragraph is still Emma's, because this fork also lets a call omit
the fields its action does not use. `ec240ff` and `cbb7f19` are described
below.

### Deliberately not taken

- **`98be58b`, remove OS command sandboxing.** Emma keeps `sandbox-exec`. The
  permission-mode commits were written on top of that removal, so their
  `PermissionSnapshot` carries no `sandbox_backend` and drops the held turn
  pair entirely. Emma keeps `active_permission_snapshot` and both call sites
  in `app_agent_runtime.zig`, and takes only the live-mode sampling the
  orchestrator does at each action boundary. `setSandboxBackend` had to
  release `authority_mutex` before `syncQueuedPermissionSnapshot`, because
  `ec240ff` made `livePermissionSnapshot` take that same lock and Emma is the
  only side that still calls one from inside the other.
- **`3ad06b9`, bound terminal exec and retain command output**, and the two
  replay-hardening commits that build on it (`b129b6e`, `4c46572`). It makes a
  finite deadline mandatory on every `terminal exec` call, which is a tool
  contract change, and it introduces a paged agent replay store Emma does not
  have. The secret-boundary fixes protect only that store.
- **`7e4bed4` and `956301e`, the automatic review rewrite.** It removes 593
  lines from the orchestrator and rewrites `auto_classifier` and
  `tool_admission` against `src/acp/prompt.zig`, which is where `callEmmaTool`
  lives.
- **`b0b855f` and `70511ff`, compact tool schema records.** Restructuring the
  property record ripples into all twenty-three native tool specs, and the
  byte-exact schema oracles it adds are pinned to upstream's tool set.
- **`cd7da07`, terminal argument decoding.** Allocation count only, against the
  decoder this fork rewrote.
- Every Grok, Codex, Vercel OAuth, setup-hub, release-infrastructure, and
  TUI-presentation commit.

Upstream's byte-exact tool schema oracles are never taken: Emma advertises a
different tool set, so those hashes cannot match by construction.

### Edit review metadata

Pending `write_file` and `edit_file` ACP calls carry `_emma_filePath`, parsed

Emma retains this path across status updates to capture before/after file
contents for review and revert; history replay does not create new captures.
